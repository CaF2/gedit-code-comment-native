# Code comment

Inspired on the original code comment plugin for gedit, but rewritten for C.

# Installation

Just follow these steps:

````
cd ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins
git clone https://github.com/CaF2/gedit-code-comment-native.git
cd gedit-code-comment-native
make
````

Then go into gedit -> settings -> plugins and enable this plugin

If it does not work, check that you have the gedit-devel package installed.
